Each request of API is protected by JWT, meaning a valid token must be included in the headers.
The only requests not protected are the login, register (POST /users) and reset password.

After login a user gets an individual token which stays valid during 15 minutes (config file)
After this period, the token becomes invalidated and eligible to refresh during 7 days
Send this token to the refresh request to get a new valid one
(this means that is a user doesn't connect to the app within 7 days he will need to authenticate again)

When login out of app, send your token to an route that invalidates your previous token
